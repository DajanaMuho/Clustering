# The CURE Algorithm For Clustering

The project will be about Clustering which is a useful technique to discover groups and
identify the distribution of the data. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning
algorithm that is able to learn patterns from untagged data. Working with traditional
clusters was noticed that in some scenarios it doesnâ€™t behave as expected. Among them
were the time complexity when dealing with a large number of dimensions and large
datasets, as well as the effectiveness of measuring the distance in multidimensional spaces.
For this reason, it was proposed in 1998 by Guha, Rastogi, and Shim a new clustering
algorithm named CURE(Clustering Using REpresentatives), that would be efficient for
large databases, more robust to outliers, and able to identify clusters having non-spherical
shapes and size variances.
